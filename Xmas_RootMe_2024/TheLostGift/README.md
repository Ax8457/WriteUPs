# The Lost Gift (day13)

This challenge  was an OSINT challenge, in which we were asked to retreive the the location of a fallen drone. To do so a network capture was provided containing the last data sent by the drone before turning off and also a picture of the last video frame captured by the drone. The flag is the name of the street where the drone landed.
