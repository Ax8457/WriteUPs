# The Lost Gift (day13)

<p align="justify">  This challenge  was an OSINT challenge, in which we were asked to retreive the the location of a fallen drone. To do so a network capture was provided containing the last data sent by the drone before turning off and also a picture of the last video frame captured by the drone. The flag was the name of the street where the drone landed. </p>

<p align="justify">  The network capture contained IEE 802.11 protocol packets. By inspecting the content of those packets, I quickly managed to extract gps coordinates that helped me mark out the area where the drone stopped transmitting : </p>

<p align="justify">  On google map, coordinates indicated me that the drone did fall while flying over a lake. Considering that the flag was the name of a street, it was clear that those coordinates wern't the exact position where the drone had fallen. </p>

<p align="justify">  Looking at the landscape one the picture provided and the location of the drone during last transmission I managed to identify the street thanks to street view feature : </p>
